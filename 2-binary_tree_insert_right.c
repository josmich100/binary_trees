/**
 * binary_tree_insert_right - Inserts a node as the right-child of another in a binary tree.
 * @parent: A pointer to the node to insert the right-child in.
 * @value: The value to store in the new node.
 *
 * Return: If parent is NULL or an error occurs, return NULL.
 *         Otherwise, return a pointer to the new node.
 *
 * Description: If the parent already has a right-child, the new node takes its place,
 * and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.
